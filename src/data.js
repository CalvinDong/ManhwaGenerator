        title: "Makeup Remover",
        genre: ["romance", "comedy", "wholesome"],
        synopsis: "Besties (or are they ðŸ‘€) Yuseong and Yeseul work together to deconstruct and tackle toxic societal norms and beauty standards in the industry and in general. We love legends. Fun makeup looks and stellar character development. Probably the only webtoon I have seen that manages to do social commentary so damn well while having an excellent plot and making you invested in the characters. Although it can get pretty real sometimes, it's just a good time overall. A great de-stressing webtoon."
